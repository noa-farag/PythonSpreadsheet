The interface includes a scrollbar for easy navigation in the table. The main goal while creating the GUI was to maximize user convenience. The table can be modified by buttons(description bellow)

2. Calculations: the table can deal with complex functions such as '=sun(min(1,2),4)' it can also calculate the square root of a single number. In adiition, the table can calculate simple trigonometric calculations such as sin, cos and tan for non radian angles. To use cell formula please start your formula with '=' (e.g. '=sin(90)')

3. 'Cell Color': option to color a cell
4. 'Back': can cancel the last formula entered by the user
5. 'Double-click': dispplay the formula inside the cell and allows direct modification
6. 'Clear Table': removes all values from table including cell color
7. 'Change Name': allows changing the name of the table, relevant mainly for file exports since tables are saved with it's name
8. Convenient navigation between cells using keyboard arrows
